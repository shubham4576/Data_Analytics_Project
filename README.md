# Data_Analytics_Project

Protective resources are less in numbers with the Army and are distributed uniformly
across the area. Similarly Explosive Detection Dogs ( ED Dogs ) are only less in the
entire country. My tool will help in finding the concentration of Attack types in
the area which would help in allocation of the resources.

As I know visualizing the data gives clear patterns about the data and makes it easy for
analysis.
